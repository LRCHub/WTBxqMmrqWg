[00:12.34] Drawing hearts on the foggy glass
[00:15.38] New love, chase away my past
[00:18.03] Nothing but the open road, saddle up, here we go
[00:20.63] One, two, three
[00:28.13] 
[00:24.04] First winter here in your arms
[00:27.00] Flames rising as we fall like the stars
[00:29.88] Making angels in the snow, warm fuzzy, frozen toes
[00:32.77] Is this a dream?
[00:40.77] 
[00:35.62] Don't wake me up
[00:40.03] If this is love
[00:43.02] Please, let me be
[00:51.52] 
[00:47.51] Swept completely off my feet
[00:52.89] This snow globe scene is turning me
[00:58.81] This Christmas Eve, "I" became "We"
[01:04.94] Don't wake me please
[01:08.57] From this winter dream
[01:19.57] 
[01:13.65] Winter dream
[01:16.62] Winter dream
[01:22.62] 
[01:23.42] Built a fire to escape the cold
[01:26.48] Ben Crosby on the stereo
[01:28.89] Chasing letter on my skin, slowly start sinking in
[01:31.90] You love me
[01:37.40] 
[01:34.43] Oh, don't wake me up
[01:39.26] If this is love
[01:42.06] Please, let me be
[01:50.56] 
[01:47.09] Swept completely off my feet
[01:52.02] This snow globe scene is turning me
[01:58.18] This Christmas Eve, "I" became "We"
[02:04.28] Don't wake me please
[02:07.56] From this winter...
[02:17.06] 
[02:10.13] Dreaming dreams while I'm wide awake
[02:13.13] The tree, the lights, staying up late
[02:16.15] It's true
[02:18.37] I'm in love with you
[02:28.37] 
[02:22.25] Swept completely off my feet
[02:27.39] This snow globe scene is turning me
[02:33.99] This Christmas Eve, "I" became "We"
[02:39.74] Don't wake me please
[02:42.96] From this winter dream
[02:53.96] 
[02:50.80] Dream, winter dream
[02:57.78] Oh, oh-oh
[03:03.49] Oh-oh
[03:06.02] Oh-oh
[03:09.77] Oh, oh-oh
[03:14.70] Oh-oh
